# MSE-485-Final


The code in 485_Final_Project.py use Grand Canonical Monte Carlo to simulate selective adsorption of hydrogen isotope by quantum sieving of the carbon nanotube.

By inputting temperature(T), pressure(P), partial pressure(x_D2) of the Detrilium(D2), it will output how selectivity, the number of the adsorbed hydrogen(H2), the number of adsorbed Detrilium(D2) change as time evolving. 

The carbon nanotube we model is (10,0) single walled carbon nanotube. And the mixture gas is idea gas.
